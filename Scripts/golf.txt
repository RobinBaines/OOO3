//This script describes a golf ball being hit by a golfclub.
//See Readme.md for conventions used in this script. 
//Objects are initialised in the Event INIT.
//The timeline object called the_swing describes the relative position of club and ball and the velocity of the club.
//The club hits the ball and a new club_ball object is created in the Event called THE_COLLISION.
//The club and ball objects are part of the club_ball object.
//Energy is transferred from club to ball during the existence of the club_ball object in the timeline object called club_ball_contact.
//While not described in the script the kinetic energy of the club is converted to potential energy by deformation of club and ball 
//before the potential energy is converted to changes in kinetic energy of club and ball.
//The club_ball_contact Timeline object ends in Event SPLIT.
//In SPLIT the club_ball object ends and club and ball objects become independent objects.

//Potentially there could be a none countable infinite number of events. 
//In practice an event is instantiated when a relevent property changes. 
//We could for example split the timeline club_ball_contact with an event to capture the moment when the potential energy is a maximum.
