//Conventions: 
//A Real Object has prefix RO_.
//The command 'type' or 'type of' is used to derive a Sensual Object from a Real Object. 'Type of' can be compared to inheritance in OOP.  
//When 2 SOs inherit from the same RO the name of the 2nd has a ' as suffix, for example in this script drop1, drop1', drop1'' etc
//are all derived from RO_drop1.

//Time is represented from left to right and has 2 implementations:
//1. A time line is a Sensual Object having a finite duration. 
//It is derived from RO_timeline, which is a single Real Object representing the time continuum. 
//2. A discrete event derived from an RO_event. A RO_event has no duration and is unique.
//RO_events will usually occur at the beginning and end of a time line SO.

//A time line may have properties place, weather....
//SOs will not be created or destroyed in a time line SO. 
//SOs will interact or be created or destroyed in an event.
//The event will have a time when it occurred and this will also be the start time of
//the time line which follows the event. 
//A event SO may succeed a time line SO and the time of this event is the end time of the preceding time line.

//This water_text script describes an inanimate interaction.
//2 drops of water collide to form a single drop which then divides
//into 2 other drops some time later when a gust of wind occurs.
//Dimensions and velocities have been chosen based on Weber numbers which correspond to coalescence of water drops on collision. 
//The Weber number is  the ratio of dynamic forces to surface tension.
//It is a dimensionless number used for describing phenomena such as droplet formation and liquid jets. 

//In this script the SO INIT is derived from RO_Event and sets up the initial Real Objects.
//The SO collision is a time line lasting 10 seconds and describes how 2 drops of water move.
//The 2 drops are represented by SOs drop1 and drop2 and positions and velocity have been chosen so they will collide.
//The dimensions and velocities of a drop are relative to the time line SO and are therefore properties of the drop SOs and not of the drop RO.

//The space coordinates are chosen so that drop1 has 0 velocity and is at the origin (x=y=z=0).
//The coordinates are also rotated so that drop2 has 0 velocity on the y and z axes and a minus velocity (v) along the x axis.
//The initial coordinates of drop2 are y = z = 0 and +ve x so that the collision occurs at time x/v.

//SO collision terminates in the event called SO THE_COLLISION. This event describes the 
//moment when RO_drop1 and RO_drop2 coalesce to form RO_bigdrop. 
//The 3 drops are represented by SOs drop1' and drop2' and bigdrop.
//RO_drop1 and RO_drop2 and drop1' and drop2' end their existence in this event.
//The RO_bigdrop and bigdrop come into existence in this event.

//Using objects to describe inanimate interaction raises the question of the role of human obsevation.
//Ideally an inanimate interaction could/should take place without the presence of a human. 
//But that seems impossible because scripting implies human presence. 
//Should we imagine the interactions described in the script based on our knowledge of water drops and wind?
//Or should we imagine filming the interaction?
//Or should we just describe a system which has the potential for the events described. And then fill in how that potential might be realised?
//Should the script include relative velocities, an attempt to predict 2 drops colliding before they do, an attempt to define a closed space around the interaction much as engineers do in 
//fluid dynamics?
//Should it include the criteria for when 2 drops coalesce or SPLIT using the Weber number?
//Density * v * v * l/surface tension.
//v = 0.1 m/s and l = 1mm => We = 0.14
//Ignore gravity => m * v * v /m * g * d = 0.01

//OOO speculates about the existence of RO and SO. It also looks for a mediation between 2 RO as RO may not interact directly.
//In the instance when the surface of the 2 drops is broken the 2 drops cease to exist and the 'bigdrop' is formed.
//Later when the gust of wind causes the bigdrop to SPLIT bigdrop ceases to exist at exactly the same instance the smaller 3rd and 4th drops come into existance.
