//Initially the stone is immersed in air and can be considered a composite of stone and air.
//The air SO is a volume of air at the front of the volume of the SO water wave. The air is a mirror image of the wave.
//The Reynolds number of approx 5500 refelects the dominance of dynamic forces over viscosity implying that the reduction in velocity of the stone is 
//insignificant in the couple of seconds before collision with the front of the wave.

//The wave SO is a volume of water from the front of the wave back into the wave (20cm * 20cm * 20cm). 
//The stone contacts the front of the wave and is at that moment a composite object of air, stone and water.
//The stone proceeds into the wave and at a certain moment is no longer in the air; it is fully immersed in the water.
//It is a that moment a composite with the wave.
//The Reynolds number of approx 100 reflects the relative importance of viscosity implying that the reduction in velocity of the stone is 
//significant in the couple of seconds after collision with the front of the wave.


//The wave and the air are continua and therefore infinite ROs in the sense that they can be endlessly divided while remaining a wave or air.
//For the purposes of the script a closed system is created by choosing SOs which enclose any effects of the stone wave interaction. 
//The script and perhaps reality accept that the wave and air SOs are finite.
